# QGIS Map Library #

This plug-in is meant for organizations or organizational units (that can be you !) as a means to provide one or more libraries of (often used) maps (layers) to the end user.

Both libraries and maps can be available local on the file system or remotely on a server accessible via http(s).

Layers can be just about any type QGIS supports, including group layers. Layers can be defined from a "connection string" defining the connection to the data, or from a QGIS layer file (.qlr) containing the connection to the data as well as styling and other properties.

Of course, entries in the library can have a meta data url associated, so the end user can find meta data for layers and sections in the library.

You will find the plug-in in the Web menu. That's also the place where you can define the library the plug-in uses.

## Version history

}
```
The value has to be defined in minutes.
